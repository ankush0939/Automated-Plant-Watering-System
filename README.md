# Automated-Plant-Watering-System

<h2>Abstract</h2>

This is an automatic plant watering system, which is considered as one of the most commonly used and the most beneficial automated systems nowadays, which help people in their daily activities by reducing or completely replacing their effort. 

This system uses sensors along with microcontroller and other electronics in order to behave like smart switching system which senses soil moisture level and irrigates the plant if necessary. Purpose of this work is to demonstrate how we can easily make own and cheap automatic plant watering system in just few hours by connecting certain electronic components and other materials required. 

As one possible agricultural solution, this system can be very helpful in keeping vegetables and other useful and specifi c plants watered for bigger harvest, which enables farmers from all around world to breed crops of these plants which are the most wanted and the most commonly used in diet. 

As medical solution, these systems can be used for purpose of cultivating certain plants that are famous and well known by their ability to remove air pollutants and therefore reduce the concentration of toxic pollutants in the air as well the occurrence of respiratory diseases. 

There are also many other possibilities like using more than one sensor or solar power supply for experimental purposes, but the fact is however, that, independently of the materials used and the way in which they are connected, this type of automated systems can be very helpful in solving very wide of human-related problems nowadays.
